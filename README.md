### Scraping Guidelines

Keep in mind you should always have permission for the website you are scraping! Check a websites terms and conditions for more info. Also keep in mind that a computer can send requests to a website very fast, so a website may block your computer's ip address if you send too many requests too quickly. Lastly, websites change all the time! You will most likely need to update your code often for long term web-scraping jobs.

## Web Scraping with Python

There are a few libraries you will need, you can go to your command line and install them with conda install (if you are using anaconda distribution), or pip install for other python distributions.

    conda install requests
    conda install lxml
    conda install bs4
    
if you are not using the Anaconda Installation, you can use **pip install** instead of **conda install**, for example:

    pip install requests
    pip install lxml
    pip install bs4
    
Now let's see what we can do with these libraries.
